    <p><b>Calculus</b>, a branch of Mathematics, developed by <i><b>Newton and Leibniz</b></i>, deals with the study of the rate of change. <i>Calculus</i> defines formulas like <i>f(2)<sup>n</sup></i><abbr title="Centimeter">CM</abbr> which are generally used in Mathematical models to obtain optimal solutions. <i>It helps us to understand the changes between the values which are related by a function.</i>Calculus Math  mainly focuses on some important topics such as <b>differentiation, integration, limits, functions,</b> and so on. Scientific calculations provide formulas like: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.</p>
